        <h3>Here are my goals for the future:</h3>
        <p>I, of course, want to achieve some sort of succesful career. But I don't strive for fame - I genuinely strive for helping people in SOME way. I don't have a figured way of doing it for now, but I think not everyone is given the same chances in life, which is something I'd like to change. Even if it's something little, I still wanna leave the world better than I found it.</p>
